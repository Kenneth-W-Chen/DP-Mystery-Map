The A Wing's been dark for hours. 
I would've turned the lights on, but it's too dark to see the switch. 
Iâ€™m afraid of the dark. Too dark, you know? 
Anyways, after we lost all our AA batteries in the freak battery-lost-in-the-incinerator accident, we ran out of batteries for our flashlights to use. 
If only there was another way.
